📈 Stock Portfolio Tracker – Python Project
📌 About the Task

The Stock Portfolio Tracker is a Python-based application that calculates the total value of a user’s stock holdings. It uses a dictionary of predefined stock prices and allows the user to input stock symbols and quantities. The program then calculates the portfolio value and provides a detailed breakdown. This project taught me how to work with dictionaries, user inputs, loops, and file handling in Python.
